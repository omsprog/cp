## Approach

1. **Find the tail of `list2`:**
    - Traverse `list2` completely to get a pointer to its last node.
    - This will later connect to the remainder of `list1` after index `b`.

2. **Locate cut points in `list1`:**
    - Traverse `list1` to find the node at position `a-1` (`cutPoint1`).
    - Also find the node at position `b` (`cutPoint2`).

3. **Reconnect the lists:**
    - Set `cutPoint1.next = list2` (head of the second list).
    - Set `tailInList2.next = cutPoint2.next` to connect the tail of `list2` with the rest of `list1`.

4. Return the modified `list1`.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time: `O(n + m)`
    - O(m) to find the tail of `list2`.
    - O(n) to traverse `list1` until reaching positions `a-1` and `b`.

- Space: `O(1)`
    - Only a few extra pointers are used for reconnection.

## Notes

- Works in-place without extra memory.
- Correctly handles edge cases where the removed segment is at the beginning or end of `list1`.
- This is the optimal approach for this problem.
