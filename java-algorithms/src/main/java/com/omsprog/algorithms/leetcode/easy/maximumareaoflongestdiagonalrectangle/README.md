## Approach

We iterate through each rectangle in the `dimensions` array and compute its diagonal length squared (`a² + b²`), which avoids floating-point operations.
- If the current rectangle has a strictly larger diagonal than the maximum found so far, we update both the maximum diagonal and its area.
- If the current rectangle has the same diagonal as the maximum, we compare areas and keep the larger one.
- At the end, we return the area of the rectangle with the maximum diagonal (breaking ties by area).

## Complexity Analysis

- Time: `O(n)`, where n is the number of rectangles. Each rectangle is processed once with constant-time operations.
- Space: `O(1)`, since only a few integer variables are used regardless of input size.

## Notes

- Using diagonal squared avoids floating-point precision issues from `Math.sqrt`.
- The area is only computed when needed:
    - once when a new maximum diagonal is found,
    - or when diagonals are equal and we need to break ties.
- This ensures the solution is both efficient and precise.
