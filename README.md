## How to approach a Problem in an Interview

1. Problem clarification:
    - Resitate the problem in your own words
    - Ask clarifying questions to gather all necessary constraints and edge cases
2. Algorithm Design:
    - Consider and discuss multiple possible solutions
    - Talk through these options, decide which one will work best and explain your choice
3. Approximate Complexity Analysis:
    - Provided an initial complexity analysis of your approach to demonstrate its effectiveness
4. Coding:
    - Use meaningful variables when possible
    - Making use of helper functions can help structure your code and avoid repetition
5. Restate Complexity:
    - Explain your reasoning, discuse trade-offs
6. Testing
    - Use a reasonable number of test cases to ensure the code is correct

## Effective Communication

The coding interview should be a conversation 

- Think out loud: Run through your thought processes
- Discuss alternatives approaches: let the interviewer know your options. Discuss pros and cons of each, and explain your final choice.
- Getting unstuck: If you find yourself stuck, explain where you are in your thought process. 
- Thinking time: It's useful to take a moment to thunk about a problem in a period of silence.

## Concepts

Time complexity from worst to best  

`O(1)` Constant   
`O(log n)` Algorithm that cuts input in half at every step. Binary Search.     
`O(n)` Traverse elements of array  
`O(n log n)` Merge sort  
`O(n ^ 2)` Nested for  
`O(2 ^ n)` Time taken doubles with each eddition to N, fibonacci  
`O(n!)`  

Space complexity: How much auxiliary memory is needed to run the algorithm
