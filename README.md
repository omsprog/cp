## Fundamentals

Time complexity from worst to best  

`O(n)` Constant  
`O(log n)` Algorithm that cuts input in half at every step. Binary Search.     
`O(n)` Traverse elements of array  
`O(n log n)` Merge sort  
`O(n ^ 2)` Nested for  
`O(2 ^ n)` Fibonacci  
`O(n!)`  

Space complexity: How much auxiliary memory is needed to run the algorithm
